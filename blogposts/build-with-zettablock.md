*A recent talk between IoTeX and ZettaBlock's Co-Founder and CEO Chi Zhang has shed light on the great opportunities that this tool provides for developers. The IoTeXperts team has therefore decided to co-write this article to show what ZettaBlock means for anybody interested or currently building on the IoTeX chain.*

## What is ZettaBlock?

ZettaBlock is a one-stop blockchain data platform to make data indexing, querying, analyzing, and sharing easy and flexible. ZettaBlock abstracts out low-level data layer APIs and queries by providing a single interface for unified on-chain and off-chain data layer access. Applications built on top of ZettaBlock can transform and serve data through their real-time, public facing API or pipe data to anywhere it goes like Postgres and Snowflake, for example. ZettaBlocks offers tremendous opportunities for developers to build real-time, reliable, data-intensive dApps in a wide range of use cases. 

By using this product, you will be able to:

- Build your own real-time, public facing APIs in minutes
- Continuously sync from blockchain nodes, databases and lakes
- Access advanced queries and analytics on 8+ blockchains since genesis
- Access rich data (110B+ transactions, 1M+ contracts & 4.3B+ price feeds, etc)
- Automatically decode smart contracts
- Build aggregated dashboards 

## A Quick Demo

In the video below, Chi will show us ZettaBlock in action: We’ll be initially exploring decoded transactions, and we’ll then create a SQL query to gain some powerful ecosystem insights such as the staking amount aggregated by each delegate on the IoTeX chain. The Query Builder allows you to manually create a query, or build one automatically based on the selected tables and columns. 

This is only the tip of the iceberg, so feel free to check out the video to learn more about ZettaBlock, or keep browsing the article.

ZettaBlock offers quick and intuitive query builder and visualization tools: By using the following SQL query, for example, you will be able to find out the total amount of IOTX staking per month:

Queries are very easily customizable, and their insights can be immediately visualized (such as in the bar chart right below), and embedded anywhere; though the best has yet to come.

This is the part where ZettaBlock really shines: You’ll, in fact, be able to create your own public facing API based on your query in a matter of seconds, while also customizing *refresh frequency*, *grouping* and *indexing* logic.

All charts created can also be added to your own dashboard to provide aggregated insights, while combining on and off chain data or bringing your own data to ZettaBlock.
