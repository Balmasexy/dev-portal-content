The new *IoTeX Developers Portal* is finally here, and it's meant to be the go-to place for the growing IoTeX developers community to meet, learn and keep up-to-date with the latest news from the IoTeX world. 

The idea is to have a common place for all the different types of users, beginners and experts alike to nurture the community and grow within it. 

When working on new technologies, such as **MachineFi**, it's really important to have as much access to various and reliable resources as possible. 
We thought that the best way of achieving this goal would be through a combination of content from the IoTeX foundation itself, as well as from its users directly. 
The users content will be vetted by IoTeX experts before being published. The more the portal grows, the more varied the documentation, the more MachineFi Dapps could be potentially built in the future.  


## For developers, by developers

The IoTeX Developer Portal is not only a way for developers to learn how to build **MachineFi** applications, but it's also an opportunity for the community to grow together as a whole. 
Experienced developers, IoT experts, or even members of the IoTex dev core team will be able to create educational content, share tips, and contribute to the platform.

## Join the Academy

The IoTeX Academy is at the core of the portal: Developers can find *Quick Starts*, *Tutorials*, or *Guides* to learn how to use IoTeX products, 
learn more about web3 and MachineFi development, and, most of all, learn how to become an important pillar of the **Machine Economy**. 
*Quick Starts* are available for devs to get going quickly and experiment. *Tutorials* will take you step-by-step through the solution of a specific problem, while *Guides* will give you the big picture, focusing on content with a broader educational scope.

## Monetize your content

We couldn't just sit there and not introduce some web3 component in the dev portal. 
Simply add your wallet to your [profile page](https://developers.iotex.io/user/profile), start receiving tips from community members for the content you post, and claim your funds at any time..

## Stay Tuned

What's the point of keeping up-to-date with the world through trusted and reliable data, without being up-to-date on the latest releases from the IoTeX world? 
Tune in on the latest tweets, and latest projects built on IoTeX or funded by the [*IoteX Halo Grants*](https://community.iotex.io/c/halo-grants/61) program.


## The Developers Blog

Use the Blog as a way of checking out latests releases, but also as a way of expanding or sharing your knowledge on a specific topic. 
Blog articles can have a wide range of content, more similar to Guides in terms of scope, but not necessarily aimed at discussing IoTeX technologies per se. 
You might, for example, find news from developers in the IoTeX ecosystem or insightful articles about designing and building MachineFi Dapps.


## See You Out There!

Enjoy the portal, share your feedback, and feel free to contribute to the community with your own content. 
Our developers portal is meant to be a rewarding place for its members and contributors alike. 
If you think your **IoT** or **Blockchain** knowledge could help others, simply go to the *Academy* or the *Blog* section and [*Start Contributing*](https://github.com/iotexproject/dev-portal-content). 
Use this portal to grow as a developer and empower others along the way.
