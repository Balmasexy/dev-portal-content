## What is W3bstream? 

W3bstream is a general framework to connect the physical world to Web3 with an innovative combination of blockchain and IoT.

In a nutshell, w3bstream uses the IoTeX blockchain to manage device ownership and orchestrate decentralized networks of w3bstream nodes to establish two-way communications between smart devices in the physical world and decentralized applications. 

With w3bstream in place:

- Device owners can **monetize on their smart devices data** by participating in certain dApps, 
- While dApp developers are able to **manage sets of smart devices** completing specific tasks.


## Get Started with W3bstream

There are a couple of ways of quickly getting started experimenting with w3bstream.

- The [official w3bstream documentation](https://docs.w3bstream.com/) offers a lot of great resources for any developer that would like to get going quickly and also learn about this technology in more depth. After a quick overview, the developer is taken through a **"get started"** and an **"applet development"** section.
- The [IoTeX Developer Portal](https://developers.iotex.io/) is another great way of quickly learning how to build **MachineFi** applications with w3bstream. To get developers started, we have prepared a simple [ClickToEarn](https://developers.iotex.io/posts/Deploy-a-MachineFi-Dapp) application that rewards users with crypto assets clicking their board.

## W3bstream Studio

Easy UX and slick UI, **W3bstream Studio** is a web tool that allows w3bstream node operators to administrate their node, deploy and run applets, and explore data.

W3bstream Studio is available as a web server integrated into the w3bstream service. Developers can access it from any browser by pointing it to their w3bstream node IP address.

## The W3bstream Whitepaper

Haven't had enough content and would like to dig even deeper into the w3bstream vision? Then reading the [W3bstream Whitepaper](https://docsend.com/view/twtxhbzvisdye2xj) is definitely the best thing to do to momentarily replace your favorite Netflix show. The Whitepaper delves into interesting concepts such as **Trust Models**, **Machine Identity**, **Web3-Devices**, the **Architecture** of a W3bstream Node, and **Communication Patterns**, just to name a few.
