## TL;DR
W3bstream offers a custom zero-knowledge infrastructure to scale applications that need verifiable processing of high volumes of data. Thanks to W3bstream, developers are able to easily build DePIN dApps based on trusted real-world events. 

The [first episode](https://developers.iotex.io/posts/building-a-depin-project-with-w3bstream) of the webinar introduced a DePIN bike-sharing application, highlighting its architecture that rewarded bike owners for listing/renting their vehicles on the network. As we proceed to our second episode, we'll take a closer look at the on-chain vehicle registration process and we'll uncover how each bike is bound to its owner, and how, following a completed ride, W3bstream ensures the associated wallet of that particular bike is rewarded.
