# Upgrade instructions

## v1.8.4 Patch

In the past couple of weeks, some delegates have come across an issue with their nodes that were failing to sync with the most recent blocks. 

After careful analysis, the root cause has been identified as an incorrect state in memory storage, which a node might incur upon restart.  

## Impact

A node could be affected by this issue if it has been restarted sometime between September 30th and October 08th, 2022. In such case, this node will get stuck on a certain block height. 

## Solution

The IoTeX core team has fixed this issue in the v1.8.4 release by providing a script tool to download a patch file, which would correctly restore the internal state of the node. 

This fix is **not a hard-fork**, and is only needed once. After applying the patch, the node can be upgraded to v1.8.4. After starting the new release, the patch will not be needed for future restarts, and can be deleted. 

Therefore, upgrading to 1.8.4 consists of 2 steps:

1. Apply the DB patch.
2. Upgrade the iotex-core protocol to 1.8.4.

## 1. Apply the patch

**Prerequisites**

Make sure you have the `$IOTEX_HOME` environment variable properly set. This is the full-node home directory where all node settings and data files are stored. By default, it is called `/iotex-var`.

```bash
echo $IOTEX_HOME
/home/user/iotex-var
```

If `$IOTEX_VAR` is not set, make sure you locate it, and set the absolute path:

```bash
export IOTEXVAR=/home/user/iotexvar # Use your specific path for iotex-var
```

If the variable is not set, you will be asked to input it when running the script.

Once `$IOTEX-VAR` is set,

- Stop your IoTeX node.
- If you are using Docker, also remove the Docker container. 
- Download the patch script:

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iotexproject/iotex-bootstrap/v1.8.4/184_patch/patch.sh > ./patch.sh
```

- Run the following script:

```bash
chmod a+x ./patch.sh
./patch.sh
```

The script will download the actual patch file. You will see a message like this:

```
download /iotex-var/data/19901069.patch success, please upgrade to v1.8.4 and restart iotex-server
```

## 2. Upgrade to v1.8.4

Now that the DB is patched, you can go ahead and update your node to 1.8.4:

- Pull the new Docker image:

```
docker pull iotex/iotex-core:1.8.4
```

- Update your run script with the new iotex-core docker image and start your node.

Assuming you've named your Docker container "`iotex`", you can use this command to check the node's log:

You should see a log like the one below:
