During this two-session workshop with the Africa Blockchain Center, we're going to be building a **MachineFi** application that leverages the **IoTeX** chain and **[W3bstream](https://w3bstream.com/)**: the IoTeX layer-2 infrastructure to connect **smart devices to smart contracts**.


The application we're going to build is called **Click-To-Earn**, and it demonstrates how to use W3bstream to connect a smart device with an **NFT** smart contract. Participants will be able to mint an NFT by clicking a button on an Arduino ESP32 board. Upon succesful completion, developers will receive the NFT on the IoTeX Mainnet to prove their participation. The NFT will also be displayed on the participant's profile in IoTeX Developer portal!


## Session 1

The first session of the workshop will be dedicated to making sure every participant has all required tools installed to successfully follow along the hands-on session of this workshop. 

The following is a list of the prerequite tools needed to follow along: 

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) editor
- [Metamask](https://metamask.io/download/) blockchian wallet extension on their browser
- [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) package manager, and the [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) tool
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) 
- **Optionally**, for those who want to use real hardware to interact with the Blockchain:
  - ESP32 Dev Board
  - [Arduino IDE](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v2/tutorials/getting-started/ide-v2-downloading-and-installing) with the following libraries installed: 
  - Arduino_Json - NTPClient - PubSubClient - WiFi - HttpClient

Using the ESP32 is not mandatory to successfully complete the workshop. Participants will still be able to send messages to w3bstream via the **W3bstream** Studio web interface.  


## Session 2 

The second session of the workshop will focus on the architecture and flow of the *Click-To-Earn* Project. Students will be able to work on the three main components of a MachineFi application: 

- Learning the blockchain logic (an NFT smart contract)
- Running a w3bstream node
- The IoT device's firmware that sends messages to the w3bstream node

Upon successful completion of the workshop, students will be able to send messages to w3bstream by clicking a button on their boards and thus be rewarded with an exclusive IoTeX NFT which will be directly sent to their Metamask wallet.

More learning material can be found on the [IoTeX Developer Portal](https://developers.iotex.io/), while a more in-depth description of the concepts dealt with throughout the workshop can be found in the [IoTeX official documentation](https://docs.iotex.io/), and in the [W3bstream docs](https://docs.w3bstream.com/introduction/readme).
