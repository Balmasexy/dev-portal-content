## Introduction
Welcome to the "Sprout Your DePIN" contest, an opportunity for developers to help testing the new **W3bstream Sprout** release. This contest challenges you to demonstrate your skills in creating zero-knowledge provers using the W3bstream Zero-Node Protocol. If you're not a zk-dev, fear not, as we also have a track for aspiring Node Operators. 

## Objectives
The contest is divided into 2 tracks. A **Node Operator** and a **zk-Circuit Builder** track, each with its own challenges and rewards. 
- **Node Operator**: You'll be asked to run a W3bstream node that can compute zk-proofs and write them to a blockchain. 
- **Circuit Builder**: Your task is to create a simple zk-circuit and deploy it to a W3bstream Node. 

## Key Technologies
- W3bstream Protocol: Integral to the IoTeX network, focusing on computing custom zk-proofs for dApps.
- zk-Frameworks: W3bstream supports Halo2, RISC0, and zkWASM provers.
- Supported Blockchains: All EVM blockchains are supported.

## Requirements
Both Node Operators and Circuits builders should visit the [Sprout repository on Machinefi Github page](https://github.com/machinefi/sprout) to learn how to run and interact with a W3bstream Node.

### Node Operators
You'll be required to: 
- Configure and run a W3bstream node on your local machine.
- Send a test message to your node triggering one of the preset examples.
- Collect the proof transaction hash from the node logs (you'll need it when submitting your application).
- Make sure the proof is written to the IoTeX testnet.

**Expected Deliverable**: Create and share a short video on the steps you've taken to complete this challenge. Extra points for the quality of your submitted content.

### Circuit Builders 
You'll be required to: 
- Configure and run a W3bstream node on your local machine
- Create a simple circuit using either of the supported frameworks (Halo2, RISC0, or zkWASM).
- The cicruit should prove knowledge of a certain wallet address input (it should be yours!).
- Send a test message to the node with your wallet address in the "0x" format. 
- Collect the proof transaction hash from the node logs (you'll need it when submitting your application).

**Expected Deliverable**: Link to your project's repository including a Readme file instructions to build your prover and generate the proof. 

## Submission Deadline
- All submissions should be done by January 6th, 2024. 

## How To Submit
- To submit, follow the steps outlined in [this form](https://iotx.typeform.com/sprout), based on your chosen category. 

## Rewards
All successful submissions in each category will receive a unique limited-edition NFT minted on the IoTeX Mainnet, available on the [MIMO NFT Exchange](https://nft.mimo.exchange/).
