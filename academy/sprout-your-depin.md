## Introduction
Welcome to the "Sprout Your DePIN" contest, an opportunity for developers to engage with the **IoTeX<>W3bstream** Protocol, specifically the Sprout release. This contest challenges you to demonstrate your skills in creating zero-knowledge proofs using the W3bstream Zero-Node Protocol.

## Objectives
The contest is divided into 2 tracks. A **Node Operator** and a **Circuit Builder** track, each with its own challenges and rewards. 
- Node Operator: You'l be asked to run a node that can generate proofs using the Halo2, RISC0 and zkWasm VMs. 
- Circuit Builder: Your task is to create a zero-knowledge circuit that proves knowledge of a certain wallet address input. This involves leveraging the capabilities of the IoTeX Zero-Node Protocol to generate custom Zero-Knowledge Proofs.

## Key Technologies
- W3bstream Protocol: Integral to the IoTeX network, focusing on generating Zero-Knowledge Proofs.
- Custom Provers and VM Support: Utilize native Halo2 circuits, RISC0, and zkWASM Virtual Machines for proof generation.
- Supported Blockchains: All EVM blockchains are supported for ZNode Proofs. For the purposes of this contest, though you'll be asked to send your proofs to the IoTeX chain. 

## Requirements
Both Node Operators and Circuits builders should visit the [Sprout repository on Machinefi Github page](https://github.com/machinefi/sprout) to learn how to run a Zero-Node and how to submit proofs. 

- Circuit Builders will be also required to create proofs using Halo2, RISC0, or zkWASM. Please make sure to test your proofs by sending data to the Zero-Node and retrieve the Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) as outlined.

## Contest Rules
- All submissions must be compatible with the supported virtual machines and blockchains.
- Code must be original and not violate any intellectual property rights.
  
## Submission Guidelines
- Follow the steps outlined in [this form](https://iotx.typeform.com/sprout), based on your chosen category. 

## Rewards
The top three implementations in each category, judged on correctness, efficiency, and innovation, will receive their rewards to the wallet address provided in the submission form.
- Node Operators: A SBT token minted on IoTeX Mainnet...
- Circuit Builders: TBD
