GeoStream is the first W3bstream-based, Layer-2 network to provide trusted GPS location of blockchain users to Web3 dApps. 
In this document, we explain how to join the GeoStream network from your iOS or Android device, and monetize your GPS location data in dApps that use GeoStream data.

# 1. Download ioPay Wallet
Make sure you have ioPay Wallet installed in your mobile phone. ioPay is the official wallet for the IoTeX Blockchain.

[Go to the ioPay website](https://iopay.me)

Once you installed ioPay, you'll have to go through the quick settings of your first wallet (or import the private key of a wallet you already own).

# 2. Enable W3bstream applications in ioPay
Access to W3bstream applications in ioPay is still limited to beta testers. You will have to enable it in ioPay to get access: make sure you access this tutorial from your smartphone with ioPay installed, then click the button below:

3. Bind geo location to wallet

Once the geo location module is opened for the first time, you will be asked to "Connect" the geo location of your smartphone to the currenly selected ioPay wallet.
<Alert>
  Make sure you selected the right wallet in ioPay before continuing. That wallet must be used to interact with supported dapp. e.g. to claim location-based NFTs or token rewards.
</Alert>

Click `Connect`, wait for the service to complete the setup process, then sign the action when the request pos up:
