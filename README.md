# IoTeX Developer Portal Content
This repository hosts blog articles and academy content for the IoTeX Developer Portal at https://developers.iotex.io

## How to contribute
Did you build a cool project on IoTeX that you want to share? Do you feel like you could write a great tutorial to help other developers? Or maybe you are a guru in a specific IoT or Blockchain technology and want to write about it? 
Below you find instructions and rules on how to submit your educational content or blog articles to the portal and become an active contibutor in the IoTeX Developers Community:

### Developer Academy
"Developer Academy" is the [section of the Developer Portal](https://developers.iotex.io/academy) where developers can find educational content to learn and improve their development skills on the IoTeX platform.
Content can be of three different types:
- **Quick Starts**: represent the minimum set of instructions to get started using IoTeX with a specific technology or product. A quick start is not intended to solve any specific problem, create a specific project, nor include more details than the minimum required to get to the point. 
- **Tutorials**: represent an accurate list of steps that anyone should be able to follow from start to end to solve one (and only one) specific problem, or implement a specific feature. Tutorials may include some educational explanations, however they should be limited to relevant observations onle and should be concise.
- **Guides**: represent content with a much broader view than a tutorial, it focuses on architecture rather than on the implementation details, as well as on best practices.

To contribute to the Academy, you can [fork this repository](https://github.com/iotexproject/dev-portal-content/fork) to your GitHub account, add a new file in the `academy` folder and create a pull request to this repository.

### Developer Blog
The "Developer Blog" is the [section of the Developer Portal](https://developers.iotex.io/academy) where latest updates from the IoTeX developers core team get published. The blog also includes news from ecosystem developers and insightful articles about designing and building MachineFi Dapps.
If you are a tech influencer in the IoT or Blockchain space, or you master any specific technology related to the space, feel free to contrubute your articles to the IoTeX Developer Blog:
